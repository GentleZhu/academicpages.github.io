I am a Ph.D student in Computer Science Department at UIUC under supervision of Prof. Jiawei Han(http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). I received my Bachelor and Master degree in Computer Science at Zhejiang University and University of Illinois, respectively.  

My research interest is weakly-supervised graph representation learning on heterogenous information networks such as citation networks and knowledge graphs. Recently, I'm working on label-efficient graph mining algorithms, especially graph neural networks.

In the past, I also worked on weakly-supervised information extraction and extractive summarization.
